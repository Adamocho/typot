## About

`typot` is a Typeracer bot written in Python

**DISCLAIMER**
`typot` is meant to be a 'flex tool', but not a cheating tool. So please use it only when racing your friends, that you know there is absolutely no chance of beating, or you're having a bad day.

I don't take any responsibility whatsoever for your banned accounts. Through my course of testing, it seems like this bot is undetectable to a point e.g. approx. 300-350 wpm is the most it can possible squeeze out before being detected (No human can type consistently at this speed, let alone without making *any* typos). If you're not satisfied with the speed - tweak the numbers yourself.

## Usage

Either way, enjoy!

To start the program, simply type
```bash
python[3] pypot.py
```
in the terminal, then, when the website fires up, click `aggree` when asked for cookies, and quickly choose your desired game mode. For now, this bot cannot make any typos, so even an **INSTANT DEATH MODE** looks like a joke at this point.
